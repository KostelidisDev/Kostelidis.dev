Software Engineer at DataScouting | BEng in Informatics | IEEE & IEEE YP Volunteer | Mentor of HERMES Team | Passionate about Innovation and Community Impact

I am a dedicated and innovative software engineer with a BEng in Informatics, hailing from the vibrant city of Thessaloniki, Greece. Since 2018, I have been working as a software engineer at DataScouting, continuously honing my skills and contributing to various impactful projects.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I co-founded and served as a software and embedded systems engineer for the HERMES Team, a cross-university project between the IEEE IHU RAS Student Branch Chapter (Serres Campus) and the IEEE University of Thessaly Student Branch (Volos Campus). Our team developed a Powered Exoskeleton for the CYBATHLON competition, a groundbreaking project that now continues under the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at UTh. Being a mentor for HERMES has been a cornerstone of my career, allowing me to guide and inspire budding engineers while working on cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of technology.

I also served my mandatory military service (2023-2024) as a Research and Informatics Corps Private at the XXV Armored Brigade in Xanthi, Greece. This experience further enriched my technical and problem-solving abilities while instilling a strong sense of discipline and teamwork.

As an active volunteer and member of IEEE and IEEE Young Professionals (YP), I am passionate about fostering innovation, sharing knowledge, and driving positive change within the tech community.

I thrive on challenges that require creative problem-solving and enjoy collaborating with like-minded professionals to create impactful solutions. My goal is to continue leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute to the ever-evolving field of technology.
